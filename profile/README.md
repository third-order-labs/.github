# Third Order Labs

Plugins and tools for people who work with AI, not just use it.

We build opinionated tools born from real workflows — writing systems, domain-specific copilots, long-form fiction engines. Everything here started as a solution to an actual problem, got tested in production, and shipped when it worked.

## Plugins

| Plugin | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| [voice-first-writing](https://github.com/third-order-labs/voice-first-writing) | Captures your authentic voice and produces content that sounds like you. Self-updating voice guide, 5-step drafting workflow, platform format guides. |
| [longform-plugin](https://github.com/third-order-labs/longform-plugin) | Maintains coherence across novel-length fiction. Continuity tracking, thread management, foreshadowing systems, living documents. |
| [coldchain-qa-plugin](https://github.com/third-order-labs/coldchain-qa-plugin) | QA automation for pharmaceutical cold chain. Deviation investigation, excursion triage, root cause analysis, CAPA management. |

## About

Third Order Labs is built by [Ian Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianaldenjones/). The name reflects how we think: first-order effects are obvious, second-order effects are predictable, third-order effects are where things get interesting.
